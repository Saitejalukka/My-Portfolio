                <h3>Stock Market Prediction using ML</h3>
                <p>I completed a project titled “Stock Market Prediction Using Machine Learning,” which focuses on minimizing financial losses for investors. The system uses machine learning models to analyze historical stock data and predict future price movements. When a user purchases a stock, the model continuously monitors its performance; if the stock is predicted to enter a loss state, the system automatically triggers a sell action to prevent further losses. This automated decision-making helps users manage risk more effectively, reduce emotional trading decisions, and protect their investments through timely loss management.</p>

                <h3>Suryaputra AI Chatbot</h3>
                <p>I completed a project titled **“API Chatbot Using Python Full Stack Development,”** which focuses on building an interactive chatbot application that provides real-time responses to users. The project integrates Python-based backend technologies with frontend components to handle user queries efficiently through APIs. The chatbot processes user input, communicates with the server, and returns relevant responses, creating a smooth and engaging user experience. This project highlights my skills in Python full stack development, API integration, and building responsive, user-friendly chatbot systems.</p>

                <h3>MockAPI</h3>
                <p>I completed a project titled “API Chatbot Using Full Stack Web Development,” which involves designing and building an interactive chatbot application. The system uses APIs to process user inputs and generate appropriate responses in real time. The chatbot provides an intuitive interface for users to ask questions and receive instant replies, improving user engagement and accessibility. This project demonstrates the integration of frontend and backend technologies, efficient API handling, and seamless communication between the client and server to deliver a responsive chatbot experience.</p>
